It _returns a list of `Thread` objects_ that represent each active thread. By default, it _returns a list of all threads_, but you can pass a Boolean argument `group=None` to get only the active threads that are started by the current process."

When you create a new thread, you can override the `run()` method and provide your own implementation for the thread's behavior. This method is called automatically when you call the `start()` method.\n",
    "2. **`start()`**: This method is used to start a new thread by calling the `run()` method in a separate thread of execution. It allocates the necessary resources for the thread and starts it running. When the `start()` method is called, a new thread is created, and the `run()` method is called automatically in the new thread.\n",
    "3. **`join()`**: This method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When you call the `join()` method on a thread, the calling thread is blocked until the thread being joined completes its execution. This is useful when you need to synchronize the execution of multiple threads.\n",
    "4. **`isAlive()`**: This method is used to check whether a thread is still executing or not. It returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the thread is alive or not. If the thread is alive, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. You can use this method to check the status of a thread and perform some action based on the thread's status."
