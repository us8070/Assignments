    "▶️ Understanding the level of measurement of a variable is important because it determines the types of statistical analyses that can be performed and the appropriate interpretation of the results. In other words, the level of measurement _helps researchers to identify the appropriate statistical procedures and tests to use when analyzing data_. Using the wrong statistical procedure for a given level of measurement can result in misleading or inaccurate conclusions.\n",

    "**For example**, let's consider a study that examines the **relationship between income and job satisfaction** among employees in a company. The _income variable is a ratio-level variable_ because it has a true zero point (no income) and equal intervals between values. In contrast, _job satisfaction is an ordinal-level variable_ because it has a specific order or rank, but unequal or non-meaningful differences between categories.  \n",
    "If the researcher were to **use a correlation analysis to examine the relationship between these two variables**, the result would be **incorrect** because _correlation is only appropriate for ratio-level variables_.  \n",
